    "FIRST_PREVIEW": "It's good to have you here. As you can see, I had contact with technology from an early age. With the arrival of the internet, I was dazzled by the idea of being able to convey information to everyone, besides the passion for games of course, who in this field never wanted to create one?! üòÅ.",
    "SECOND_PREVIEW": "Without further ado, my journey began in 2019 just before the COVID pandemic, where I did a complete immersion, from Monday to Monday, studying and practicing to become a full-stack developer. I started and successfully completed the",
    "THIRD_PREVIEW": "course, which I dedicated more than 1500 hours improving my skills, not only technical but also social. Four months before graduating, I was hired as a junior developer by VP6 consultancy. I experienced first-hand what it's like to work with big names from the beginning, providing services to companies such as Banco Inter, Pif-Paf, Patrimar, ViewCO and others. Thanks to this and the excellent tutors who gave me important lessons, I experienced exponential personal and curricular growth, which guaranteed me a position as a full developer at the most highly regarded company in Latin America, ",
    "FULL_TEXT_ONE": "Well, if you've made it this far, it means you're curious to know a little more about me beyond all this professional stuff, right?! A good time to start is when I was 12 years old, when I joined a break dance group. The importance of this event is due to my soft-skills in dealing with many people and overcoming challenges. It may not seem like it, but I've danced on stages in front of more than 50 thousand people. I got involved in several social projects, made art (graffiti) and led people.",
    "FULL_TEXT_TWO": "When I turned 17 in 2007, I started studying to become a helicopter pilot. I graduated and worked as an aircraft mechanic to get more involved in that world. For another 8 years, I struggled to get my private pilot's license and realized that, just with my effort and my financial condition at the time, I was wasting my potential. Finally, with all the money I had saved up to that point, I decided to invest in myself in another way and moved to Canada.",
    "FULL_TEXT_THIRD": "My move to Canada went very smoothly thanks to the kindness and patience of those close to me. In the 3rd month I was already working and communicating well. I lived for 1 and a half years in Whistler, British Columbia. Always learning something is very important to me and because I am very dedicated, I stood out as a cleaner at the Aava hotel and was promoted to the maintenance sector. As I was single, I ended up accepting another promotion and started working in auditing at night where I got back involved with this technological world. I closed the day and started a new one, in addition to welcoming new guests who arrived at night.",
    "FULL_TEXT_FOURTH": "During my time in Canada, I visited Brazil a few times and met my wife. I can say that returning to Brazil was the best decision I made in my life. Upon my return, I was able to attend the birth of my son and it was in that year - 2019 - that I discovered the course of ",
    "FULL_TEXT_END": "Today I am very happy and fulfilled. My current desire is to give my family the freedom and choice to do what they always dreamed of, without all the economic worries."
