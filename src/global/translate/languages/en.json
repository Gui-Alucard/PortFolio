    "FIRST_PREVIEW": "It's good to have you here. As you can see, since 1996 I had already had contact with technology and with the arrival of the internet. I was dazzled by the idea of being able to convey information to everyone and in addition to my passion for games - of course - who in this field has never wanted to create one?! üòÅ.",
    "SECOND_PREVIEW": "Without further ado, my journey began in 2019 just before the COVID pandemic where I did a complete immersion, from Monday to Monday, studying and practicing to become a full-stack developer. I started and successfully completed the",
    "THIRD_PREVIEW": "course, where I dedicated more than 1500 hours improving my skills not only technical but also social. Four months before graduating, I was hired as a junior developer by VP6 consultancy. I experienced what it's like to work with big names from the beginning such as Inter Bank, Pif-Paf, Patrimar, ViewCO and others. Thanks to that and the excellent tutors who gave me important lessons, I had an exponential personal and curricular growth which guaranteed me a position as a full-stack developer at the most highly regarded company in Latin America, the ",
    "FULL_TEXT_ONE": "Well, if you've made it this far, it means you're curious to know a little more about me, besides all this professional stuff, right?! A good time to start is from when I was 12 years old when I joined a break-dance group. The importance of that event is due to my soft skills in dealing with many people and overcoming challenges. It may not seem like it but I have danced on stages in front of more than 50 thousand people. I got involved in several social projects, made art (graffiti) and led members.",
    "FULL_TEXT_TWO": "When I got my 17's in 2007, I did start studying to become a helicopter pilot and during this period, I graduated and worked as an aircraft mechanic to become more involved in this world. For another 9 years I struggled to get my private pilot's license and realized that just with my effort and my financial condition at the time, I was wasting my potential. Finally, all the money I had saved up to that point I decided to invest in myself in another way and moved to Canada.",
    "FULL_TEXT_THIRD": "My move to Canada was very chill thanks to the kindness and patience of those close to me. In my 3rd month I was already working and communicating well. I lived for 1 and a half years in Whistler, at the British Columbia. Always learning something is very important to me and because I am very dedicated, I stood out as a cleaner at the Aava hotel and was promoted to the maintenance sector. As I was single, I ended up accepting another promotion and started working with auditing at night and ended up getting back involved in this technological world, where I closed the day and started another in addition to welcoming new guests who arrived during the night.",
    "FULL_TEXT_FOURTH": "During my time in Canada, I visited Brazil a few times and met my wife. I can say that returning to Brazil was the best decision I have ever made in my life. Upon my return, I was able to attend the birth of my son and it was in that year - 2019 - that I discovered the course of ",
    "FULL_TEXT_END": "Today I am very happy and fulfilled. My current desire is to give to my family the freedom and choice that a first world country, like Canada, has for its citizens."
